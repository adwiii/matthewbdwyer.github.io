<p>This paper gives a brief overview of our updated pattern system,
describes our survey of property specifications, and presents
the results of the survey (extracted from the raw data that is linked below).

<p>In addition to the basic patterns, we have developed tool support
for defining the atomic propositions that parameterize patterns
in terms of the execution behavior of a Java program.

<p>Some papers reporting on applications of FSV that use patterns.  The work on developing case studies for these papers inspired the need for and informed the structure of the pattern system.
