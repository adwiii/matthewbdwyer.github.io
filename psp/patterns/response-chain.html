<h1>Order Specification Patterns</h1>

<p><b>Intent</b></p>

<p>This is a scalable pattern.  We describe the intent of the 1
  stimulus - 2 response version here.</p>
  
<p>To describe a relationship between a stimulus event (<TT>P</TT>)
  and a sequence of two response events (<TT>S,T</TT>)
  in which the
  occurrence of the stimulus event must be followed by an occurrence
  of the sequence of response events within the scope.
  In state-based formalisms, the states satisfying the response must
  be distinct (i.e., <TT>S</TT> and <TT>T</TT> must be true in different
  states to count as a response), 
  but the response may be satisfied by the same state as the
  stimulus (i.e., <TT>P</TT> and <TT>S</TT> may be true in the same state).</p>

<p><b>Examples and Known Uses</b></p>

<p>If a resource allocator grants a process access to a resource 
(<TT>GrantRes</TT>),
the process will start using the resource (<TT>BeginRes</TT>)
and finish using the resource (<TT>EndRes</TT>).</p>

<p><b>Relationships</b></p>

<p>This pattern is a generalization of 
    the <a href="response.html">Response</a> pattern.
    If you wish to restrict the occurrence of states/events between
    stimuli or responses use the  
    the <a href="constrained.html">Constrained Response Chain</a> pattern.</p>
    
<p>This is an <a href="order.html">Order</a> pattern.</p>
