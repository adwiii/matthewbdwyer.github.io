I am interested in techniques that make it easier to build software
that "does what you expect" and in determining,
after you've built that software, what it actually "does"
when you use it.

<h2>Resources</h2>
With colleagues I have developed resources to support research activities
by the broader community.  Several of them are linked below:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../psp">Property Specification Patterns</a>
</ul>

<h2>Publications</h2>
Other people keep track of the papers I've published, but it usually
takes some months for these sources to be updated.  If you are interested
in a recent paper send me an email.
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100013564">ACM Digital Library</a>
<li> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ZRKCcEAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dwyer:Matthew_B=.html">DBLP</a>
</ul>

<h2>Students</h2> 
One of the best parts of my job involves working with bright, motivated
students.   I learn at least as much from them as they do from me.

Here are two interesting explanations of what a PhD education is
all about from quite different perspectives.
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">The Ph.D. grind</a> by Philip Guo
<li> <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.</a> by Matt Might
</ul>
I felt both the grind, explained by Philip, and the inspiration, that
is implicit in Matt's explanation, in my education.  My aim is to minimize
grind and maximize inspiration for my own students; some grind is unavoidable (i.e., research is hard or someone would have already done it). 

I found this book when I was in grad school and it was full of
guidance about how to pursue scientific discovery.  
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/83">The Incomplete Guide to the Art of Discovery</a> by Jack Oliver
</ul>
I should find time to reread it on a regular basis.

<h2>Community Service</h2>
I believe that the field of software engineering
develops most effectively when people build on each others
work through a cooperative, rather than a competitive, process.
I work to support that process by helping to organize
and run meetings and journals where people can report on and share their work.
