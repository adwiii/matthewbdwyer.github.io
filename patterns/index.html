<h1>Temporal Specification Patterns</h1>

  <p>This page is the home of an online repository for information about property specification for finite-state verification. The intent of this repository is to collect patterns that occur commonly in the specification of concurrent and reactive systems. Most specification formalisms in this domain are a bit tricky to use. To make them easier to use our patterns come with descriptions that illustrate how to map well-understood, but imprecise, conceptions of system behavior into precise statements in common formal specification languages. We're already support mappings to a number of formalisms that have tool support for automated analysis.</p>
