<h1>The Patterns</h1>

<p>
The information in the patterns can be presented in a variety of ways.
One organization, illustrated below, 
is based on classifying the patterns in
terms of the kinds of system behaviors they describe.

<ul>
<li> <a href="./patterns/occurrence.html">Occurrence Patterns</a> talk about the occurrence of a given event/state during system execution.
<li> <a href="./patterns/order.html">Order Patterns</a> talk about relative order in which multiple events/states occur during system execution.

<li> While not themselves patterns, 
<a href="./patterns/notes.html">Pattern Notes</a> discuss common ways
to vary the existing patterns to suite your needs.
</ul>
<p>
An alternative organization for this information is to group
pattern to formalism mappings by specification formalism.
The supported formalisms are listed below.
Clicking on the formalism will bring you to pages with mappings for
each property pattern in that formalisms.  
We supply the mappings on these formalism-specific pages
and you are refered to the complete patterns
for information about relationships and example uses.
<ul>
<li> <a href="./patterns/ltl.html">Linear Temporal Logic</a> (LTL)
<li> <a href="./patterns/ctl.html">Computation Tree Logic</a> (CTL)
<li> <a href="./patterns/gil.html">Graphical Interval Logic</a> (GIL)
<li> <a href="./patterns/qre.html">Quantified Regular Expressions</a> (QRE)
<li> <a href="./patterns/inca.html">INCA Queries</a>
</ul>

Mappings for additional formalisms have also been developed (by 
other researchers)
