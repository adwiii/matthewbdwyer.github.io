<h1>Precedence Property Pattern</h1>

<p><b>Intent</b></p>

<p>To describe relationships between a pair of events/states
   where the occurrence of the first is a necessary pre-condition for
   an occurrence of the second.  We say that an occurrence of the second
   is enabled by an occurrence of the first.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Example Mappings</b></p>

<p>In these mappings <i>P</i> is the consequent and <i>S</i> is
the enabling state/event.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=ctl.html#Precedence>CTL</a></li>
  <li><a href=ltl.html#Precedence>LTL</a></li>
  <li><a href=qre.html#Precedence>QRE</a></li>
  <li><a href=inca.html#Precedence>INCA</a></li>
  <li><a href=gil.html#Precedence>GIL</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Examples and Known Uses</b></p>

<p><a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a> properties occur quite commonly in specifications of concurrent systems.  One common example is in describing a requirement that a resource is only granted in response to a request.</p>

<p><b>Relationships</b></p>

<p>Note that a <a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a> property is like a converse of a <a href="response.html">Response</a>
    property.  <a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a>
    says that some cause precedes each effect, 
    and <a href="response.html">Response</a> says that
    some effect follows each cause.  They are not equivalent, because
    a <a href="response.html">Response</a> allows effects to occur 
    without causes (<a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a>
    similarly allows causes to occur without subsequent effects).</p>
    
<p>Note that this pattern does not require that each occurrence of
    a consequent will have its own occurrence of an enabling condition.</p>
    
<p>This is an <a href="order.html">Order</a> pattern.</p>
