<!--#set var="title" value="Response Property Pattern" -->

<!--#include virtual="/header.html" -->

<p><b>Intent</b></p>

<p>To describe cause-effect relationships between a pair of events/states.
   An occurrence of the first, the cause, must be followed by an occurrence
   of the second, the effect.  Also known as <B>Follows</B> and <B>Leads-to</B>.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Example Mappings</b></p>

<p>In these mappings <i>P</i> is the cause and <i>S</i> is
the effect.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=ctl.html#Response>CTL</a></li>
  <li><a href=ltl.html#Response>LTL</a></li>
  <li><a href=qre.html#Response>QRE</a></li>
  <li><a href=inca.html#Response>INCA</a></li>
  <li><a href=gil.html#Response>GIL</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Examples and Known Uses</b></p>

<p><a href="response.html">Response</a> properties occur quite commonly in specifications of concurrent systems.  Perhaps the most common example is in
    describing a requirement that a resource must be granted
    after it is requested.</p>

<hr>
    
<p><b>Relationships</b></p>

<p>Note that a <a href="response.html">Response</a> property is like a converse of a <a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a>
    property.  <a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a>
    says that some cause precedes each effect, and <a href="response.html">Response</a> says that
    some effect follows each cause.  They are not equivalent, because
    a <a href="response.html">Response</a> allows effects to occur without causes (<a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a>
    similarly allows causes to occur without subsequent effects).</p>

<p>Note that this pattern does not require that each occurrence of
    a cause will have its own occurrence of an effect.</p>
    
<p>This is an <a href="order.html">Order</a> pattern.</p>
