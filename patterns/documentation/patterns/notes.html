<h1>Property Specification Pattern Notes</h1>

<p>The patterns provided in this system cover a broad range of
requirements for real systems.  Your requirement, however,
may require you to adapt existing patterns slightly
to better express your intended property.
There are a number of ways in which this variation can take place, e.g.,
parameterization of patterns, combination of patterns,
and variation in pattern scopes.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Pattern Parameterization</b></p>

<p>Pattern mappings are presented in terms of place-holder symbols
(e.g. <tt>P,Q,R,S</tt>) that are to be replaced by users
when writing actual specifications.  These place holders are filled
with descriptions of specific system states or events of interest.
These descriptions can be more complex than just a single proposition
or event name.  Here are a few typical examples:</p>


<p>For Logics (e.g., <a href="ctl.html">CTL</a>, <a href="ltl.html">LTL</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li> Purely propositional formula can always be used to describe a state.
This includes simple negations, disjunctions, conjunctions and implications.
<li> State-formulae that include temporal operators can also be used (e.g.,
<code>[]!init</code> responds to <code>init</code> globally would be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[](init -> <>[]!init)</tt><br>
Care must be taken in using such state-formulae, since the 
meaning of the resulting specification can be quite subtle.
This is especially true when using scopes that may have an end point,
i.e., before, between and after-until.  Consider a requirement
that before the first <code>shutdown</code> state we would like it to
be the case that <code>request</code>s are <code>respond</code>ed to.
We know that a succesful response has the form:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[](request -> <>respond)</tt><br>
and we might be tempted to use this as a parameter in 
a before-scope universality pattern.  The resulting formula: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><>shutdown -> (([](request -> <>respond)) U shutdown)</tt><br>
however, does not express the correct requirement.  In particular the
<code><></code> operator when embedded in the scope
does not take into account the fact that the search for <code>respond</code> should
terminate upon encountering <code>shutdown</code>.  One can modify this by
expanding the <code><></code> to its until form, e.g., <code>true U respond</code>,
then requiring that throughout the search the <code>shutdown</code> is 
absent (this is similar to the constrained response discussed below). 
The resulting formula is:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><>shutdown -> (([](request -> (!shutdown U respond))) U shutdown)</tt><br>
</ul>

<p>For <a href="qre.html">QREs</a></p>

<p>Each portion of a specification "matches" some portion of program
behavior.  This "matching", which is inherent to an automata based
specification model, means that a portion of input is consumed for
each portion of a specification.  This has some implications for
the way's that patterns can be parameterized.
<ul>
<li> Choice among a collection of events (e.g., disjunction) 
can be handled relatively simply by using symbol classes 
(e.g., <tt>[x,y,z]</tt>).
<li> Requiring a sequence of events is also simple 
(e.g., <tt>x;y;z</tt>), although such a sequence implies
that there are no intervening events in the sequence.
<li> Notions of conjunction (i.e. having all of a collection of
events occur) are significantly more complex to specify.  In this
case it is necessary to explicitly describe the possible
orderings of the constituent events (e.g., <tt>x;y</tt>,
<tt>y;x</tt>).  The same caveat about intervening events
holds here as well.
<li> Given the "matching" as consumption model of QREs, it is not
possible to "look ahead" in the computation to formulate descriptions
of certain points in the execution (e.g., as the lookahead for
<tt>r</tt> in the LTL formula
<tt><>r -> !q U r</tt> does).
</ul>

<p><b>Pattern Combinations</b></p>

<p>A system's specification usually consists of a collection of 
property specifications.</p>

<p>Conjunctions</p>

<p>It is most often the case that all
such property specifications should hold.  In this case, one
could simply check all specifications individually and require
that all are successful.  For the logical formalisms, an alternative
is to conjoin the individual specifications into a single larger
specification.
While this is semantically equivalent, it may be the case that
a larger specification is less efficient to verify (e.g., the cost of
LTL to Buchi automaton construction can be large for automata-based
model checkers).  For this reason,
preserving, and verifing, the individual property specifications is suggested.</p>

<p>Disjunctions</p>

<p>There are two views of a pair (or more generally
a collection) of alternative individual property specifications:

<ul>
  <li> system behaviors <b>all</b> correspond to one specification
or they <b>all</b> correspond to the other specification</li>

  <li> <b>some</b> of the system behaviors correspond to one 
specification and the <b>rest</b> of the behaviors correspond
to the other specification</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these alternatives corresponds to the checking of
individual property specifications independently and disjoining
the results.  This is true for all specification formalisms.
The latter situation can be achieved in formalisms that allow
specifications to be disjoined under the same universal path quantifier.</p>

<p>For LTL and QREs there is an implicit outer universal
path quantifier, thus checking of a top-level disjunction of specifications
will achieve these semantics.
To achieve the first alternative (above) one must check LTL and
QRE specifications separately.</p>

<p>This is not the case for CTL, where two specifications cannot
be disjoined directly under the same path quantifier.
A top-level disjunction CTL achieves the first alternative
and the second cannot be achieved directly (although one might
be able to rewrite a combined version of the two specifications).

<hr>

<p><b>Scope Variations</b></p>

<p>Most event-based formalisms use some version
of an interleaved model of concurrent computation.  In such
formalisms, two events cannot coincide.  Event-delimited scopes are
thus open at both ends: an event that occurs within the scope cannot
occur at the same time as an event that marks the beginning or end of
the scope.  For state-based formalisms, the situation is different.
Consider, for instance, a scope that begins with a state in which
proposition <tt>Q</tt> holds and ends with the next state in
which <tt>R</tt> holds.  If we want to specify that proposition
<tt>P</tt> does not hold within this scope, we have to decide
what should happen if <tt>P</tt> is true at either of the
states marking the endpoints of the scope.</p>

<p>We have chosen to define scopes for state-based formalisms that
include the state marking the beginning of the scope but do not
include the state marking the end of the scope.  Thus, for example,
the LTL version of this specification would be <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[]((Q & o<>R) -> (!P & o((!P) U (R | [](!P)))))</tt><br>
which requires that
<tt>P</tt> be false in the state where <tt>Q</tt> holds
but does not require <tt><b>P</b></tt> to be false when
<tt>R</tt> becomes true.  We chose these closed-left/open-right
scopes because they are relatively easy to encode in specifications
and beacuse they work for the real property specifications we
studied.<p>

It isn't very hard, however, to modify the mappings to open the scope
on the left or close it on the right.  An LTL specification of the
"<tt>P</tt> is absent between <tt>Q</tt> and
<tt>R</tt>" property with a scope that is open on the left
would simply remove the first <tt>!P</tt>:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[]((Q & o<>R) -> (o((!P) U (R | [](!P)))))</tt><br>
allowing <tt>P</tt> to
hold at the state marking the beginning of the scope.  Similarly, to
close the scope on the right, we have to require <tt>!P</tt> to
hold until a state in which both <tt>R</tt> and
<tt>!P</tt> are true:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>[]((Q & o<>R) -> (!P & o((!P) U ((R & (!P))| [](!P)))))</tt><br>
<p>
Similar modifications can be made
to adjust all the mappings for the various versions of the scopes.
<hr>

<p><b>Constrained Order Patterns</b></p>

<p>Order related patterns describe sequencing relationships between 
specified states or events.  It is sometimes the case that one wishes
to specify not only the sequencing relationship, but that the region
between the states or events in that relationship is free of 
some other events. We provide <a href="constrained.html">constrained chain</a>
patterns to address this issue for 
<a href="precedence-chain.html">precedence</a> and
<a href="response-chain.html">response</a> chains.</p>

<p>The plain <a href="response.html">response</a> pattern 
also has a constrained variation.  For example, one can restrict <tt>Z</tt>
from the region between <tt>P</tt> and the <tt>S</tt> that responds
to it in LTL, but converting the <code><></code> to its <code>U</code>
equivalent then embedding <tt>!Z</tt> in its left operand.  The global
response mapping:<br>
<pre>
[](P -> <>S)
</pre>

<p>becomes: <br>
<pre>
[](P -> (true U S))
</pre>

<p>and finally:<br>
<pre>
[](P -> (!Z U S))
</pre>

<p>A similar transformation to the <code><></code> in the after scope
can be applied.  The before, between and after-until scope versions
of the LTL response mappings already unfold the <code><></code> to
its <code>U</code> form.  In these cases, one need only embed the <code>!Z</code>  
in the proper place (which is identified by looking for the <code>S</code>
appearing as the right operand of the <code>U</code>).  For example, the
between response mapping :<br>
<pre>
[]((Q & <>R) -> (P -> (!R U S)) U R)
</pre>

<p>becomes:<br>
<pre>
[]((Q & <>R) -> (P -> ((!R & !Z) U S)) U R)
</pre>
<p>
Modifications for mappings in other formalisms can be applied as well.
Global and between scope versions of constrained response in CTL are:
<pre>
AG(P -> A[!Z U S])

AG(Q -> !E[!R U (P & !R & (E[!S U R] | E[Z U S]))])
</pre>

<p>The global version mirrors the LTL modifications.  The between scope
version is different because the CTL spec is expressed in terms of
the lack of a violating sequence.  In this case, we must enumerate
the possible violating sequences, i.e., a missing 
response <code>E[!S U R]</code> or the occurrence of a constrained
state before the response <code>E[Z U S]</code>.</p>

<p>Global and between scope versions of constrained response as QREs are:
<pre>
[-P]*; (P; [-S,Z]*; S; [-P]*)*

[-Q]*; (Q; [-P,R]*; (P; [-S,R,Z]*; S; [-P,R]*)*; R; [-Q]*)*; (Q; [-R]*)?
</pre>

<p>Multiple propositions can embedded in the constraint by using conjunction
in the logics and by listing multiple events in QREs.</p>

<p>It is important to note that constrained response is different from
absence with a between scope.  The latter, which in LTL is:
<pre>
[]((Q & <>R) -> !P U R)
</pre>

<p>does not require the closing of the scope (which corresponds to the
responding state).
