<h1>Universality Property Pattern</h1>

<p><b>Intent</b></p>

     only states that have a desired property.
     Also known as <B>Henceforth</B> and <b>Always</b>.</p>

<p><b>Examples and Known Uses</b></p>

<p>This pattern can be applied in most situations where the absence pattern
     can be applied.  This is especially true for state-based formalisms,
     e.g., where mutual exclusion could be formulated as absence or
     universality with a between scope.</p>

<p><b>Relationships</b></p>

<p>This pattern is closely related to the <a href="absence.html">Absence</a> 
     and <a href="existence.html">Existence</a> 
     patterns.   Universality of a state can be viewed as absence of
     its negation.  For event-based formalisms, we look for the existence
     of the positive event and absence of the negating event.</p>
