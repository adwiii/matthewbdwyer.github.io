<h1>Constrained Chain Property Patterns</h1>

<p><b>Intent</b></p>

<p>To describe a variant of response and precedence chain
  patterns that restrict user specified events from occurring
  between pairs of states/events in the chain sequences.</p>

<p>Consecutive pairs of states/events in chain sequences are
  refered to as links.  This pattern allows specification of
  the absence of states/events from individual links.</p>

<p><b>Example Mappings</b></p>

<p>This variant of chain patterns can be applied to any kind of 
response or precedence chain.  Here we illustrate mappings for
the constrained 1-2 response chain.</p>

<p><b>Examples and Known Uses</b></p>

<p>Constrained chain patterns are surprisingly useful.  Some of our recent
work with model checking of GUI software used CTL mappings for 
constrained 1-2 response patterns with global scope 
(e.g., <tt>AG(P -> AF(S & !Z & AX(A[!Z U T])))</tt>).
In the following, <tt>user</tt> indicates that the user is allowed
to interact with the GUI, <tt>select, print, help, ok, ...</tt> are interactions
that the user can perform, and <tt>error, address</tt> are system responses.
<ul>
<li> When a system error message is displayed the only allowable action is 
user acknowledgement via the 'ok' button.<br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AG(error -> AF(user & !(print | help | ...) & <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AX(A[!(print | help | ...) U ok])))<br>
</tt>

<li> When the user selects a customer the address information is displayed
before the user is allowed another interaction .<br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AG(select -> AF(!user & AX(A[!user U address])))<br>
</tt>
</ul>

<p>The latter example had <tt>!user</tt> filling the role of both
<tt>S</tt> and <tt>!Z</tt> in the mapping and it was simplified.</p>

<p><b>Constraining Other Chain Mappings</b></p>

<p>Introducing constraints into mappings for chain links depends on
the formalism and scope of the mapping.</p>

<p>In LTL or CTL with global and after scopes, the future operators (i.e.,
<tt><>X</tt> in LTL and <tt>AF(X)</tt> in CTL) can be expanded
to their until equivalents (i.e., <tt>true U X</tt> in LTL and
<tt>A[true U X]</tt>), then the true can be replaced by the
negation of the constraining formula.</p>

<p>In LTL or CTL with before, between, and after-until scopes, untils
are used for expressing each link and these can be selectively
constrained by conjoining the negation of the constraining
formula on the left of the until operator.</p>

<p>In QREs for all scopes, the interval between link endpoints
is expressed with a <tt>[- ...]</tt> operator.  Adding the constraining
formula as an argument of this operator achieves the link constraint.</p>

<p><b>Relationships</b></p>

<p>Aside from the obvious relationship with the 
<a href="chain.html">Chain patterns</a>, constrained
chains are similar to 
<a href="absence.html">Absence</a> patterns in the sense
that each link constraint is like a small absence pattern (with a
between scope).</p>

<p>This is an <a href="order.html">Order</a> pattern.</p>
