<!--#set var="title" value="Order Specification Patterns" -->

<!--#include virtual="/header.html" -->

<p>Order patterns are used to express requirements related
to pairs of states/events
during well-defined regions of system execution.  As with
our other patterns, the regions are defined using 
<a href="scopes.html">Scopes</a>.</p>

<p>Information about the patterns system as a
whole is available at the <a href="/">Specification
Patterns Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>
There are two basic order-related patterns:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="precedence.html">Precedence</a></li>
  <li> <a href="response.html">Response</a>, aka Follows, Leads-To</li>
</ul>
<p>
Chain patterns are used to express requirements related
to complex combinations of individual state/event relationships.
These include precedence/response relationships consisting of
sequences of individual states/events.  We call these chain patterns.
<p>
There are two variations of chain patterns:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="response-chain.html">Response Chains</a></li>
  <li> <a href="precedence-chain.html">Precedence Chains</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A variation of the chain patterns is to
<a href="constrained.html">constrain</a> the regions between
the state/events that constitute the chain sequences.</p>
