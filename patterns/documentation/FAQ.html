<LI> <EM>Why is a specification pattern system needed for finite-state
verification?</EM>
 <P>
Although finite-state verification methods are largely automatic, 
freeing the user from the need to understand the details of the
verification process, users of finite-state verification tools still
must be able to specify the system requirements in the specification
language of the verification tool. 
 <P>
Most programmers are unfamiliar with the formal specification
languages used by verification tools.
The effort required to
acquire an adequate level of expertise in writing these specifications
represents a substantial obstacle to
the adoption of automated finite-state verification techniques.
Providing an effective way for practitioners to draw on a large
experience base can greatly reduce this obstacle.
 <P>
The specification pattern system enables the transfer of
experience between practitioners by providing 
a set of commonly occurring properties and examples
of how these properties map into specific specification languages.
We believe this can assist
practitioners in mapping descriptions of system behavior into their
formalism of choice, and that it may improve the transition of these
formal methods to practice.
 <P>

<LI> <EM>What is a specification pattern?</EM>
 <P>
A property specification pattern is a generalized description of a
commonly occurring requirement on the permissible state/event sequences
in a finite-state model of a system.  A property specification pattern
describes the essential structure of some aspect of a system's
behavior and provides expressions of this behavior in a range of
common formalisms.
 <P>

<LI> <EM>What formalisms/tools are currently supported?</EM>
 <P>
Currently, we provide mappings to 
<UL>
<LI> Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
<LI> Computation Tree Logic (CTL)
<LI> Quantified Regular Expressions (QREs)
<LI> The Inca query language
<LI> Graphical Interval Logic (GIL)
<li> Action Computation Tree Logic (ACTL)
<li> Regular Alternation-Free Mu-Calculus
</UL>
Thus any tool accepting property specifications in these formalisms
can be used with the pattern system. Such tools include:
<UL>
<LI> SPIN (accepts LTL)
<LI> JavaPathFinder (accepts LTL)
<LI> SMV (accepts CTL)
<LI> FLAVERS (accepts QREs)
<li> CADP/EVALUATOR (accepts ACTL and Mu-Calculus)
</UL>

 <P>

<LI> <EM>What is the scope of a pattern?</EM>
 <P>
The <EM>scope</EM> of a pattern is the extent of the program
execution over which the pattern must hold.  There are five basic
kinds of scopes: global (the entire program execution), before (the
execution up to a given state/event), after (the execution after a
given state/event), between (any part of the execution from one
given state/event to another given state/event)
and after-until (like between but the designated part of
the execution continues even if the second state/event does
not occur).  
The scope is determined by specifying a starting and 
an ending state/event for the pattern. 
 <P>
For state-delimited scopes, the interval in which the 
property is evaluated is closed at the left and open at the right end.
Thus, the scope consists of all states beginning with the
starting state and up to but not including the ending state.
We chose closed-left open-right scopes because they are relatively easy
to encode in specifications and they work for the
real property specifications we studied.  It is possible,
however, to define scopes that are open-left and closed-right
as well.
In event-based formalisms the underlying model does not
allow two events to coincide, thus
event-delimited scopes are open at both ends.
 <P>
Scope operators are not present in most specification formalisms
(interval logics are an exception).  Nevertheless, our experience
strongly indicates that most informal requirements are specified as
properties of program executions or segments of program executions.
Thus a pattern system for properties should mirror this view to
enhance usability.
 <P>

<LI> <EM>How did you validate the pattern mappings?</EM>
<P>
Mappings were validated primarily by peer review amongst the 
project members, with assistance from
several other people on selected pattern mappings.  Some of the mappings
also underwent testing by running existing FSV tools to analyze 
small finite-state
transition systems which encode (un)satisfying sequences of states/events.
<P>

<LI> <EM>How can I find the pattern for the property I need to verify?</EM>
 <P>
We have organized the patterns into a simple hierarchy, with links
between related patterns. By searching down the hierarchy to the
kind of property you need (e.g., existence of an event, ordering of
events), browsing some specific patterns that sound relevant, 
and possibly following links to related patterns, you should be
able to locate a pattern that is at least close to what you want.
 <P>

<LI> <EM>What if my property is not an existing pattern?</EM>
 <P>
Even if your property does not match any pattern in the system,
it may be close to an existing pattern, which can give you a start.
 <P>
Also, looking at similar properties and their mappings can help you
learn standard idioms of the specification language (e.g., how do I
require one event follow another), which in turn can assist you
in writing the property yourself. If you find a property that does
not fit into our pattern system, please submit it to us.
Development of a pattern system is a community activity requiring
participation by a broad range of experts both in patterns and in the
formal specification domain.
 <P>

<LI> <EM>How can I contribute a pattern/mapping to the system?</EM>
 <P>
Other people have extended the pattern system significantly.

<li>
</ul>
If you would like to do the same, we suggest
using a format similar to our own by including an intent,
example(s) of known uses, relationships to existing patterns,
and as many mappings as you have worked out. 
Also linking back to this site might be valuable for users of
your extension.
