The course project provides a context for you to study
an aspect of program analysis or compilation more deeply.
Projects must apply or extend concepts discussed in the class.
Projects must involve a substantial implementation and evaluation
component.  The project will be documented in a written
report whose details are described below. 

Projects can be done individually or in teams of two.

\section*{Part 1 (12 points)}
Prior to November 8, 2019 you should discuss your
project with the instructor, receive approval that the
project is adequate, and write up a weekly work plan with
a schedule for how you will conduct the project.

A brief description of the project and your weekly plan should
be submitted, via email, to the instructor no later than
November 8, 2019.

\section*{Part 2 (36 points)}
Projects will vary greatly, so there is no one form for their
description.  Your report should take the form of a 
conference paper in ACM Standard format (\url{https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip}). The report must include an abstract, a motivation 
section that clearly defines the problem being solved,
a discussion of background and related work, a presentation
of the core contribution of the project, a section describing
the evaluation of the project outcomes, and a bibliography
with appropriate citations.

In addition, you are expected to submit any additional artifacts,
e.g., source code, test cases, etc., developed in your project
in a form that permits the instructor to ``replicate'' your work.
For example, if you extend the \texttt{tipc} compiler you must
provide everything necessary to build and test your extension.

You will be graded on the organization of the report,
the quality and clarity of the written content of the report,
the replicability of your project,
and quality of the technical work carried out on the project.

All project materials must be submitted no later than December 06, 2019.
