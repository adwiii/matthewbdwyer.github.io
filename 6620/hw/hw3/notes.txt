SSA interval range analysis

define an interval class
  - bot (so we really have a lift lattice)
  - top
  - const(c) function returns [c,c]
  - abstract operators
  - initializing widening constants
  - widening operator

abstract state: map from variables to interval

dfs visit along def-use chains
  - iterate until fixpoint
  - could this be improved based on SSA
