updated slides from last time thanks to Maggie's suggestion

restart on slide 7

Liveness:
 - you will notice as we go through these analyses that there are some points of variation
 - with Signs analysis we were computing sound approximations of the values a variable can take on at each program point
   - intuitively, this requires analysis of past program execution
   - i.e., you need to understand the state of the program on entry to a statement in order to compute the result of the statement
 - with liveness we will be interested in future program execution
   - this will cause multiple other aspects of the analysis to change slightly
   - variables will capture information BEFORE a statement, rather than after
   - we will join the values of CFG SUCCESSORS, rather than predecessors
   - we will want to initialize the CFG EXIT, rather than the entry
 - we sometimes refer to analyses like Signs as "forward" and analyses
   like Liveness as "backward"

slide 11:
 - point out the GEN-KILL nature of these constraints
   - GEN with union
   - KILL with "\" set difference, you can think of this as "subtraction"
 - this is a very common form for transfer functions
 - note that these rules are a bit incomplete, e.g., return
 - does anyone have an idea of how we can implement "vars(E)"?

slide 12:
 - point out the indirect recursion here
   - from x>1 towards the top, to z=z-1 towards the bottom

slide 17:
 - is this forward or backward?
 - what will that mean for the formulation of this analysis?
 - in Signs and Liveness, the notion of a "safe" solution was that
   it might describe "too many" elements, e.g., values, variables, 
   but it can NEVER contain "too few" relative to the true solution
 - things seem different for available expressions
 - what will that mean for the formulation of this analysis?
   - structure of the lattice, definition of join

slide 21:
 - note here that we are using intersection here to combine predecessor
   values, this is JOIN for our reversed lattice

slide 28:
 - is this forward or backward?
   - implications
 - what is the notion of safety of answers?
   - implications

slide 34:
 - is this forward or backward?
   - implications
 - what is the notion of safety of answers?
   - implications
