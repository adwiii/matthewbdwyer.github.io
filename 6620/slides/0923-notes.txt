slide 12:
  - every time we apply the interval transfer function we then apply widening
  - this widening operator generalizes the interval to one that can be 
    represented just with the values in B
  - if B = {-\infty, 0, 1, 7, \infty}
    - x \mapsto [8,8] widens to [7,\infty]   
      - 7 is the largest value in B that does not overapproximate 8
      - \infty is the smallest value in B that does not underapproximate 8
    - y \mapsto [0,1] widens to [0,1]   
      - since 0 and 1 are in B
    - y \mapsto [0,2] widens to [0,7]   
      - 7 is the smallest value in B that does not underapproximate 2

slide 15:
  - fix f \subseteq f(fix \omega) \subset fix \omega
  - as we will see this follows from the fact that \omega is monotone
    and extensive

slide 16:
  - note that repeated applications of f can never lead us to
    underestimate fix f, but we will hopefully underestimate fix \omega
