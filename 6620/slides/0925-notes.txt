Correction on HW2

slide 2:
  - these are the values after the loop exit 
  - B is 0, 1, 17 and the infinities
  - we can see that these results are imprecise
    * at the exit of the loop x>0 is false so an upper bound of infinity is very imprecise
    * the increments of y only happen when y is less than 17, so an upper bound of infinity is very imprecise
    * we know that x is positive at the start of every loop iteration
    * so z is only ever incremented by a positive number, so a lower bound of negative infinity is very imprecise

slide 5:
  - what are we trying to do with asserts?
    - we want to restrict the values of x to those that are consistent
      with the assertion
    - we are willing to overapproximate those values
    - that is what our prior analysis without asserts did

  - go back to interval lattice from prior lecture

  - what is least upper bound?
    * the smallest interval that subsumes both
    * [l1,h1] join [l2,h2] = [min(l1,l2),max(h1,h2)]

  - what is greatest lower bound
    * the largest interval subsumed by both
    * [l1,h1] meet [l2,h2] = 
        if (h1 < l2 || h2 < l1)
           bottom
        else
           [max(l1,l2),min(h1,h2)]
  - important!
    * if the two intervals are disjoint then the lower bound is \bottom

  - think through some examples:
    * [2,4] > [0,6]
      * [2,4] meet [0,\infty] = [2,4]  
      * the values of X that may be greater than E
    * [0,6] > [2,4]
      * [0,6] meet [2,\infty] = [2,6]  
      * the values of X that may be greater than E
    * [2,2] > [3,4]
      * [2,2] meet [3,\infty] = \bottom  
      * which is unreachable!!
      * by construction this is impossible, since the if condition guards the assert

slide 12:
  - here we are tracking the relevant information
  - the updates are done component-wise
  - THERE IS NO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO
  - so the value of the flag component doesn't influence the update of open/closed

slide 14:
  - we achieve this interaction by using a map lattice from information about the execution context, e.g., paths
  - note that changing the lattice to a map from paths, means that our transfer functions need to take paths as a parameter
  - we will use a lambda abstraction to denote this

slide 15:
  - think of these lambda abstractions as functions returning a constant
  - in other words for any path context, return "open"
  - the flag updates simultanously change the image of the map for both values
  - in last definition we use q because p is taken to join predecessors

slide 16:
  - the asserts here compute the incoming value of flag value that is consistent with assert condition and rule out the one that is impossible

This is a fascinating area of program analysis
 - the introduction of targetted precision
 - there are methods for automatically determining the predicate combinations to use
 - if you are interested in this I am happy to chat as this was the topic of my PhD thesis in 1995
