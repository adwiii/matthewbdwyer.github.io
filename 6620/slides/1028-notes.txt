Discussion slots for project Nov. 1
 - no office hours on Thurs. Oct. 31

For X=*Y; imagine the following program:

if (c) 
  Y = &a;
else
  Y = &b;
X = *Y;  // at this location

Draw picture of memory cells for a and b

at the location Y could point to either of those cells
  - draw edges
  
we denote this as
  [[Y]] = { [[a]], [[b]] }

We handle each element of the set for Y with a conditional constraint
  - the conditioned constraint is just the inclusion for an assignment

For *X=Y; a variant of the program:

if (c) 
  X = &a;
else
  X = &b;
*X = Y;  // at this location

Just erase the Ys and put Xs in their place
