<h1>Compilers</h1>

This is the web-site for the Fall 2019 offering of graduate-level
compilers at the University of Virginia.

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<dt>Time</dt> <dd>Mon/Wed 10:30-11:45</dd>
<dt>Location</dt> <dd>Rice 340</dd>
<dt>Reading</dt> <dd>No required textbook, we will work through the lecture notes on <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/">Static Program Analysis</a> (SPA) and selected research papers 
</dl>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
This is a graduate course that will require you to learn new algorithms and implement those algorithms in multiple settings.   
This may require a degree of independence that you have not have had to practice in prior studies.
<ul>
<li> you should be familiar with compilers, e.g., through an undergrad PL or compilers course;
<li> you may need to learn new programming languages, e.g., Scala, C++11;
<li> you will have to study and understand large-scale software systems, e.g., LLVM;
<li> you will read research papers and work to understand and explain the key ideas in the papers to others; and
<li> you will work collaboratively with other students and share what you learn in class, e.g., through presentations.
</ul>
This is a course where you will learn both analytically, e.g., by reading, thinking, and discussing, and by doing, e.g., by implementing systems and evaluating them.

<h2>Grading</h2>
There will be four different kinds of assignments.
<dl>
<dt>Exercises (24%)</dt> <dd>3 small programming exercises, in Scala, that add functionality to the TIP compiler</dd>
<dt>Paper analysis (14%)</dt> <dd>read and report on a research paper</dd>
<dt>Pass analysis (14%)</dt> <dd>read, understand, and explain an LLVM pass</dd>
<dt>Project (48%)</dt> <dd>a programming project based in LLVM that, e.g., adds features to the existing TIP compiler, extends the TIP language and compiler.</dd>
</dl>
The assignments can be done in teams of 2, but you cannot have the same partner for multiple assignments.

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
The course will be broken into three parts: ~7 weeks of coverage of static program analysis, ~4 weeks covering static analysis in LLVM, and ~3 weeks covering emerging research topics.  We may adapt the schedule as we go.
