<h1>Compilers</h1>

This is the web-site for the Fall 2019 offering of graduate-level
compilers at the University of Virginia.

<h2>Logistics</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Time</dt> <dd>Mon/Wed 10:30-11:45</dd>
<dt>Location</dt> <dd>Rice 340</dd>
<dt>Reading</dt> <dd>No required textbook, we will work through the lecture notes on <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/">Static Program Analysis</a> (SPA), selected research papers (see below), and code (e.g., LLVM APIs, TIP Scala)
</dl>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
This is a graduate course that will require you to learn new algorithms and implement those algorithms in multiple settings.   
This may require a degree of independence that you have not have had to practice in prior studies.
<ul>
<li> you should be familiar with compilers, e.g., through an undergrad PL or compilers course;
<li> you may need to learn new programming languages, e.g., Scala, C++11;
<li> you will have to study and understand large-scale software systems, e.g., LLVM;
<li> you will read research papers and work to understand and explain the key ideas in the papers to others; and
<li> you will work collaboratively with other students and share what you learn in class, e.g., through presentations.
</ul>
This is a course where you will learn both analytically, e.g., by reading, thinking, and discussing, and by doing, e.g., by implementing systems and evaluating them.

<h2>Grading</h2>
There will be four different kinds of assignments.
<dl>
<dt>Exercises (24%)</dt> <dd>3 small programming exercises, in Scala, that add functionality to the TIP compiler</dd>
<dt>Paper analysis (14%)</dt> <dd>read and report on a research paper about LLVM</dd>
<dt>Pass analysis (14%)</dt> <dd>read, understand, and explain an LLVM pass</dd>
<dt>Project (48%)</dt> <dd>a programming project based in LLVM that, e.g., adds features to the existing TIP compiler, extends the TIP language and compiler.</dd>
</dl>
The assignments can be done in teams of 2, but you cannot have the same partner for multiple assignments.

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<h2>Papers</h2>
Papers related to LLVM that you can select to study.
We can extend this set if you know of a paper that is related to LLVM that you would like to suggest.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos13/hotos13-final69.pdf">-Overify</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2737965">Alive</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3062372">Alive-Infer</a>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04422">Souper</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3192377">Crellvm</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3062343">Taming undefined behavior</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1993532">Csmith</a> 
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2594334">Equivalence modulo inputs</a> 
</ul>

<h2>Passes</h2>
This is a list of LLVM passes that you can select to study.
Interesting studies might involve comparing two related analyses,
e.g., constant propagation vs. sparse conditional constant propagation.
These are either pure analysis passes or transformation passes
that make use of computed analysis results.
<ul>
<li>Alias Analysis
<li>Dependence Analysis
<li>Dominance Frontier
<li>Induction Variable Users
<li>Global Mod/Ref Analysis
<li>Dead Code Elimination
<li>Constant Propagation
<li>Dead Store Elimination
<li>Combine Redundant Instructions
<li>Loop Invariant Code Motion
<li>Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation
<li>Promote Memory to Register
<li>Tail Call Elimination
<li>Loop Strength Reduction
<li>Global Value Numbering
</ul>
There are many more examples listed <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html">here</a>

<h2>Projects</h2>
This is a list of project ideas that will provide the chance to
dig in to the details of representing, analyzing, and transforming
programs with LLVM.   These are based, primarily on implementing
features of TIP in the <span style="font-family:courier">tipcc</span>
<dl>
<dt>Type Checking</dt> <dd>Currently we access type information from TIP, but this project would do the type checking within <span style="font-family:courier">tipcc</span></dd>
<dt>Records</dt> <dd>This feature is not implemented, but you can do it</dd>
<dt>Arrays</dt> <dd>TIP doesn't have these, but you can add them</dd>
<dt>Port Analysis</dt> <dd>TIP implements several analyses, reimplement several of them as an LLVM pass applied to bitcode generated by <span style="font-family:courier">tipcc</span></dd>
<dt>Testing</dt> <dd>Build a CSmith-like differential testing system for TIP using <a href="https://github.com/renatahodovan/grammarinator">Grammarinator</a>; the TIP .g4 grammar makes it easy to get started</dd>
<dt>more to come</dt> <dd> </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Schedule</h2>
The course will be broken into three parts: ~7 weeks of coverage of static program analysis, ~4 weeks covering static analysis in LLVM, and ~3 weeks covering emerging research topics.  We may adapt the schedule as we go.
