<h2>General Reading</h2>
The following are <em>must have</em> books if you are very
interested in model checking.  They are great supplements to the
material in this course, but I am not requiring them.  I have copies
of each if you'd like to borrow them, but I will only loan them for
short periods of time, e.g., 2 days.
<ol>
<li> "Model Checking" by Clarke, Grumberg and Peled (available 
from MIT Press or the usual online book stores)
<li> "The SPIN Model Checker : Primer and Reference Manual", by Holzmann
(available online).
</ol>

<h2>Bogor Specific Reading</h2>
The research papers on Bogor are collected <a href="http://bogor.projects.cis.ksu.edu/papers/index.shtml">here</a>.  If you haven't alread read the 
ESEC/FSE 2003 paper "Bogor : An Extensible and Highly-Modular Model Checking Framework" you should do that; other papers will become relevant as we
introduce more of the course content.
<p>


<p>
<h2>Additional Reading</h2>
Students in this course usually end up reading several additional
papers as background for their project.  I'll link things here as
they become relevant.

<h2>Announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li> Class will meet on Friday Aug. 27 at 3:30pm
<li> To access the course materials you will need to register at the
web-site.  Once you do that I believe cookies will be stored that will
eliminate the need to login subsequently.
<li> I spoke too soon in class.  The video streaming tools do not support
the linux platform.  It works just fine on Windows under MSIE.  It is
advertised to work on Mac OS X, but I'm currently having trouble getting
it to work.  I've got a request in for support from the company.
<li> Note that when you install Eclipse and then GEF you may need to
delete the "configuration" file in $ECLIPSE_HOME and restart Eclipse
to get the feature registered; similarly for Bogor.  You can look at
"About Eclipse Platform" in the "Eclipse" menu and then "Feature Details"
to see if everything is installed; similarly for "Plug-in Details".
<li> There will be no class on Monday Sept. 13th.  Instead we will have
class on Wed. Sept. 15th and Fri. Sept. 17th.   Lectures on Bogor's 
architecture should be posted to the web-site in the next day or
so.  
<li> The first homework will be posted on Wed. Sept. 15th and we will
discuss it in class.  If you haven't become familiar with Bogor and
BIR models yet, you should work on that in the next day or so.
<li> I've posted some supplemental readings above; more to come.
<li> Note that we've expanded the amount of time to cover Bogor's
architecture and the writing of extensions.  We had a group of people
visit Kansas State last week who had done alot of "homework" on 
Bogor and it still took quite some effort for them to get up to
speed; it's better not to rush through this material.
<li> The extension hacking session was a great success.  We had 8
people who stayed to the bitter end and 6 of those had working
extensions.  Thanks to Matt and Robby for showing us the ropes!
<li> No class on Monday, Oct. 4 or Oct. 8 2004.
<li> The extension lectures by Robby are now available.

<h2>Online Documentation and Resources</h2>
Much of the content for the course is available at the site
<a href="http://model-checking.courses.projects.cis.ksu.edu/index.shtml">
Software Model Checking : Theory and Practice</a>.
<p>
The role of this web-site is to describe details that are specific
to the offering of the course at UNL in the Fall of 2004.
<h2>Additional Online Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li> The Q&A forum for bogor is available <a href="http://bogor.projects.cis.ksu.edu">here</a> under "Forums".
<li> There are lots of good Eclipse tutorials undeer Help in Eclipse.
<li> Some patterns tutorials that may help you understand Bogor's design are available at <a href="http://www.techtutorials.info/patterns.html">tech tutorials</a>.

<h2>Overview</h2>
The course is broken into five parts: 
<ol>
<li> core state space exploration algorithm (weeks 2-3)
<li> architecture of Bogor (weeks 4-5)
<li> specification checking (weeks 6-7)
<li> reductions and optimizations (weeks 8-11, 12)
<li> project reports (weeks 14-15)
</ol>
<p>
During the course of the semester I'll be linking material into 
this weekly schedule for your convenience.  This material will
be drawn from the <a href="http://model-checking.courses.projects.cis.ksu.edu/index.shtml">Software Model Checking : Theory and Practice</a> web-site.
There is tons of material there; feel free to explore.
