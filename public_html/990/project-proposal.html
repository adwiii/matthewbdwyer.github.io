<h1>Software Model Checking (CIS 990) Project Proposals</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
Projects come in two flavors: <em>extensions</em> of Bogor and 
<em>applications</em> of Bogor to new domains.  
<p>
At this stage of the project you should have a very clear idea
of what problem you are solving, what strategies you might use
to solve it, what will be required to implement those strategies
in Bogor and how you will evaluate the solution.  In this proposal,
you will describe all of these proposal elements.
<p>
You will receive feedback to help steer you in a productive
direction for the final five weeks of the course.
<p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
Each proposal should clearly state:
<h3>Problem being addressed</h3>
For application projects, explain the problem domain, what challenges
there are in reasoning about problems in that domain, and why
state space search is an appropriate solution to support reasoning
in that domain.
<p>
For extension projects, explain what limitation of Bogor you are addressing.
Is a specific feature lacking?  Is there an existing feature that does
not perform sufficiently well? 
<p>
For all projects, you should illustrate the problem by way of a small
but compelling example that you can use to explain to the entire 
class why your project is potentially interesting.
<p>
<h3>Solution strategy proposed</h3>
For application projects, explain how you are going to use Bogor
to address your domain-specific modeling and reasoning problem.
Will you simply use existing BIR?  Will you extend BIR with new
modeling primitives, if so what primitives do you currently have
in mind?
<p>
For extension projects, explain the feature or capability that you
are adding to Bogor.  Is it a new specification or modeling capability?
Is it an optimization of some sort?  A refinement of an existing 
capability?
<p>
For all projects, you should illustrate your solution by way of
the small example that you introduced earlier in the proposal.
Your goal is to demonstrate to the class that your project
can potentially address the <em>problem</em> you identified.
<p>
If you have multiple candidate solution strategies, describe
how you plan to perform an evaluation of them to determine
their relative advantages.  It is important that for this project
you focus enough effort on one of them to see it through to a
reasonable conclusion, of course if you want to work out more
than one solution that is great.
<p>
<h3>Restrictions or limitations</h3>
This is only a course project so you are not expected to provide
a fully-general or highly-optimized solution.  Nevertheless, you
are expected to understand what fragment of the <em>full problem</em>
you are addressing.  You must state all assumptions you are making
about the systems that your solution will treat, this includes
explicitly listing restrictions or limitations on your approach.
<h3>Implementation plans</h3>
Projects will involve a combination of model construction, i.e.,
development of BIR models, and Bogor extension implementation.
You should be able to describe how you will proceed with the
development of the solution artifacts for your project.
What modules will you be extending?   Will you build source
extensions?   Will the implementations be modeled after any
existing modules or extensions?
<h3>Evaluation plans</h3>
It is important to evaluate the results of your project on
more than the simple example in this proposal.  You should
list a set of problems that you will apply your solution
to.  You need not have all of the details of those problems
worked out right now, but you should describe properties
of those problems.  
<p>
Think of this as presenting a very early test plan where you
are describing classes of inputs that will exercise the
solution you are providing with respect to the issues raised
in your description of the <em>problem</em>
<p>
<h3>References or resources used</h3>
Many projects will involve reading from research papers or
other resources.  You should keep a running list of citations
so that you can incorporate it into your final writeup.
Start right now in the proposal and include any citations
that are relevant.
<p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
You will present your project proposal during class on either
10/17/04 or 10/19/04.  We will plan a 10 minute time slot 
for the presentation which will give us 5-6 slots per class
period (allowing some time for questions).  Prior to class 
you need to email me either powerpoint or PDF for me to load on my laptop.
<p>
Time slots are available on a first come first serve basis.
I will receive requests via email in the order of their arrival.
