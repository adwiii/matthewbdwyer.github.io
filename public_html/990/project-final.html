<h1>Software Model Checking (CIS 990) Project Writeups and Presentations</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
Now that you have developed your project you need to describe
what you have done, what you have learned and any followon
work that you feel is warranted.
<p>

<h2>Writeup:</h2>
Your writeup should be a complete account of your efforts on this
project.  It must include the following basic elements:
<ul>
<li> Problem statement : clearly describe the problem you are solving
<li> Solution strategy : explain how you are solving the problem and where model checking and Bogor fit in
<li> Illustrative example : you must provide a small, but non-trivial, example that exposes the problem and is used in your explanation to illustrate the solution
<li> Bogor implementation : a detailed discussion of how you have used, modified or extended Bogor to achieve the solution
<li> Evaluation and findings : explain how you have evaluated the solution and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of your solution
<li> Limitations : describe any limitations of your solution
<li> Related work : as with any scholarly work you must clearly explain what is new in your project and how you have built of the work of others, proper citation of that work is essential
<li> Next steps : if you were to continue this project, explain what you would do next
</ul>
There is not strict length requirement for the writeup, but I expect they 
will be in the 10-20 page range.  They should be well-written, proof-read,
spell-checked, etc. -- quality counts.


<h2>Presentation:</h2>
You will give a 25 minutes presentation that highlights the essential
elements brought out in your writeup. 5 minutes will be allocated
for questions.
<p>
The organization and clarity of your talk will be taken into account
in grading.  So, practice your talk! 
Note that you will not be allowed to exceed 25 minutes and
if you do not present the required elements you will lose points.

<h2>Incompletes:</h2>
If you are worried that you will not finish the project in sufficient
detail or quality to get the grade you hope for, you must let me know
by 12/13/2004 at the latest.  I am willing to make arrangements for
completing projects prior to commencment of the Spring semester, but
only if you discuss it with me.

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
You will present your project to the class on 12/14/2004, between
10am and 5pm.  We will have a 15 minute break at 11am,
a 75 minute at 12:15pm, and a 30 minute break at 3pm.
Prior to that date 
you need to email me either powerpoint or PDF for me to load on my laptop.
<p>
I reserve the right to shuffle the order of presentations to
accomodate student scheduling conflicts.
In the absence of conflicts,
time slots are available on a first come first serve basis.
I will receive requests via email in the order of their arrival.
