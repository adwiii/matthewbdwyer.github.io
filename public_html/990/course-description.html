<h1>Software Model Checking (CIS 990)</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>
The trend in modern software construction is toward
<em>concurrent</em> and <em>distributed</em> systems.  In addition,
the amount of software in embedded systems such as micro-controllers
in automobiles, aircraft, medical devices, military equipment, etc. is
increasingly dramatically.  Unfortunately, the inherent size and
complexity of such systems prohibit classical validation techniques,
such as testing and technical inspections, from providing high levels
of assurance of reliability and correctness.  This is an especially
important issue in embedded systems, because embedded software must be
<em>extremely reliable</em> before it is deployed since failures
can mean loss of life and/or huge financial costs.  Moreover, it
is usually hard to update embedded software once it is deployed.
<p>
Although originally applied to hardware systems,
finite-state verification (FSV) techniques such as model-checking
are emerging as the front-runner
in the race to automate high-quality assurance of software.  In FSV, 
a computational system's behavior is modeled as a finite-state
transition system (an automaton);
properties to be verified are stated in a complementary
formalism such as temporal logic formulas
or finite state automata.  
Property verification
is performed by mechanically
enumerating all reachable states in the transition system and
checking that the property holds at each state.
Although this technique takes worst-case
exponential time, it has been used nonetheless to
validate crucial properties of
on-board spacecraft controllers,
network protocols,
graphical user interfaces, 
railway interlocking systems, and industrial control
systems.
<p>
In this course, we will study various model-checking techniques with
the goal of applying those techniques to real concurrent software systems to 
address the problems described above.
While we will study foundational issues related to explicit-state 
model-checking algorithms and abstraction, the emphasis will be on 
<ul>
<li> understanding
the methodology and processes that one needs to go through to
apply model-checking to software and 
<li> developing an in-depth understanding of existing model-checking tools
-- particularly, the <a href="http://bogor.projects.cis.ksu.edu">Bogor</a>
model-checker developed by at Kansas State University.
</ul>
Far from being removed from practice, 
software model-checking is being actively investigated and applied 
at a number of industrial and government research labs.
In addition to model-checking tools developed at Kansas State, 
we will be discussing developed at Bell Labs (Spin,Verisoft), 
NASA Ames (JPF), and Microsoft Research (SLAM).

<h2>
Schedule:
</h2>
<i>Lecture:</i> Lectures will be held Monday and Wednesday 3:30 - 4:45.  
The meeting room is Avery 118.
The schedule will be "flexible" -- meaning that classes may be 
cancelled due to instructor travel or they may be shifted, e.g.,
to Friday at 3:30, in certain weeks. 
<p>
During the last third of the course we will
shift into a more project-oriented mode where meetings
will focus on student projects and will in many cases be student led.
An essentially identical version of this course is being offered
at Kansas State University this semester by John Hatcliff and Robby.
We are planning, near the end of the semester, to hold
mini-workshop where students from UNL and K-State get together
to present their projects to one another; the location is
to be determined.
<p>

<p>
<h2>
Prerequisites:
</h2>
It will be very useful for students to have
significant Java programming experience (as their projects will
involve Java development).
A basic knowledge of logic and automata theory will also be helpful.
If you bring some specialized knowledge of program flow analysis,
testing, or software specification to the course that is great and
it means you may be able to do a more substantial "researchy" project.

Instructors: </h2> 
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cse.unl.edu/~dwyer">Matthew Dwyer</a>, 
Avery 365, Office Hours: 10:00a.m. -- 11:00a.m. Tuesday and Thursday
(dwyer@cse.unl.edu)
</ul>

Marking Scheme:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Homeworks  (30%)
<li> Quizes  (20%)
<li> Course Project (with written & oral presentation/defense) (50%) 
</ul>
<p>
The course homeworks and projects will focus on use and modification
of the Bogor model-checker.

<h2>
Grading Policy:</h2>
The course web-page will give the due dates for all of the 
homework.  This is to facilitate your planning and time-management.
Given this we expect assignments to be turned in on the due date unless
prior arrangements have been made; late assignments receive the
following penalties: 
<ul>
<li> < 30 hours late -- .5% reduction for each 10 minute increment past
the submission deadline
<li> > 30 hours late -- no credit
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Grading scale:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><font size="4">A: 90% -- 100% </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">B: 80% -- 89% </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">C: 70% -- 79% </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">D: 60% -- 69% </font></li>
    <li><font size="4">F: below 60% </font></li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> To receive a grade of <em>A</em> in the course, you
must receive at least a <em>B</em> on the course project
(to receive a <em>B</em>, you must get a <em>C</em>, etc.).
Otherwise, your grade will be assigned at the discretion of the instructor.

<h2>
Computer Access: </h2> 
This course involves a significant amount of <i>programming</i>
using Java and other software tools.  All of these
these can be accessed by you (for free) and installed on your
own machine.
<p>

<h2>Attendance policy:</h2> 

<p>Faithful attendance to all lectures is strongly
urged but not required.   As outlined above we will be having periodic,
and unannounced, quizes during class, so absence risks a zero on that
quiz.  You are responsible for any material presented
or referenced during lectures.
