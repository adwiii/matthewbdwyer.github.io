<title>CSE 990 Homework 1</title>

<h1>CSE 990 : HW #1</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The goal of this requirement is for you to become more familiar
with writing BIR models and using Bogor to "reason" about model 
behavior.  In this assignment, you will create a model, encode
several correctness properties and then attempt to determine
whether those properties are satisfied.  
<p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
You are to define a model of multi-way barrier synchronization with
information exchange.  
<p>
A barrier synchronization serves to block
each thread in a group of client threads until all threads have "contact"ed
the barrier at which point all clients involved in the current round of
synchronization are "release"d.
Your model should allow "M" client threads to be created the
and barrier should allow "N" client threads to synchronize,
where "M" and "N" are parameter that can be varied across runs.
You may use 
any mechanism you choose to implement the notions of "contact" 
and "release".
<p>
A barrier with information exchange is one where each client "deliver"s
data to the barrier when it arrives.  The barrier then performs a
calculation with all of the data items when all clients have arrived
and delivers to the clients a value (usually calculated from the supplied
client data).  You will have each client deliver an integer value to the barrier;
the barrier will deliver the maximum value back to the
clients.  You may use any mechanism you choose to implement the 
notion of "deliver".
<p>
Your model should use client and barrier threads that repeatedly 
execute rounds of barrier synchronizations.
<p>
Your model should satisfy the following correctness properties:
<ul>
<li> No more than "N" threads may be blocked at the barrier at any time
<li> The barrier does not release a participant until all have arrived
</ul>
You are free to use any mechanism to check the validity of those
properties (e.g., including adding additional state variables to
monitor program behavior).

<h2>Requirements</h2>
You are to submit a working BIR model for the multi-way barrier with
information exchange.  You must include a short writeup describing
your model and how you checked the desired correctness properties.
If you find errors in the BIR model as you explore it's behavior with
Bogor, please describe those as well.

<h2>Due Date</h2>
This assignment is due on Sept. 30, 2004 at 5pm Central Standard Time.
I will setup an electronic submission system.
