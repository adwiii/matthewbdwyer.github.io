Careers in Research : A Workshop for Undergraduates<br>

<h2>Research Careers</h2>
<p>
A career as a researcher can be rewarding on many levels.
Think of how the NASA JPL researchers who developed 
Spirit and Opportunity <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/104471main_rm_cheer_full.jpg">felt when those rovers
landed safely</a> and first started <a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/all/1/n/1850/1N292419488EFF99KZP1929R0M1.JPG">driving across the Martian
surface</a>.  Think of how the NASA researchers who developed
the Hubble space telescope felt when unprecedented
images of the galaxy were first collected, like 
<a href="http://hubble.nasa.gov/hubble20th_lg.jpg">this one
of a stellar nursery in the Carina Nebula</a>
<p>
The goal of the workshop is to give you a glimpse of what
it is like to be a researcher at a place like NASA and to
discuss what it takes to qualify yourself to be employed as a researcher.
