</div>
<br>
<p>Each team will submit a written report and give a presentation, to
demonstrate progress made since the first progress report 
project. Include a detailed review of the project work done this semester.
If you have changed direction on your project, you should explain
why and the impacts that will have on your schedule and the end product
you produce. 
Below is more detailed description of what should be
included in the written and oral reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionaly, each team member will submit a peer evaluation of every
other team member and a self-evaluation, relating to the effective
functioning of the team, using the provided evaluation form (<a
 href="Peer-team-evaluation.doc">doc</a>,&nbsp;<a
 href="Peer-team-evaluation.pdf">pdf</a>). You will be asked
to do the same with the second and the final reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall from the syllabus that the second progress report is worth 20%
of your final grade, based on:&nbsp; 50% on the technical merit of the
design (common grade for the team); 25% on the quality and clarity of
the report (common grade for the team); and 25% on the quality and
clarity of the presentation (individual grades within a team may vary).
Further, the self and peer evaluations are worth 10% of individual
grades for the entire semeser.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Written Report:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
The report should contain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">what</span>] 
A description of the functionality that you have implemented
and working; demonstrations of that functionality should be provided.
A description of the functionality that you are currently 
working on and its status.  A description of functionality that
you have yet to implement, but plan to implement before the
end of the semester.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">how</span>]
Provide a refined description of your development practices.
Touch on how you are managing system configurations as you
proceed through development, what release processes you have
in place, and other process issues you have encountered and
developed solutions for during the semester.
Select one of the elements of functionality you have implemented
and provide a more detailed description of how you developed
that functionality.  Describe successes and obstacles, and how
you worked around them, in achieving that functionality.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">quality</span>]
As we enter the final portion of the semester your attention
should be turning more towards evaluating the quality of your
system and addressing inadequacies you find.  Describe in some
detail your testing and evaluation efforts.  Illustrate on
at least one component of your system how you have taken a
systematic approach to assessing its quality.  Provide the
results of that assessment and explain why it is convincing
evidence of correct operation.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">risk-analysis and mitigation</span>]
With just 5 weeks left in the semester there is little time to
recover from problems that impact your project's critical path.
Explain what processes you have put in place to detect problems
quickly, work around them, and provide redundancy across the team
for loss of time by team members.   Provide two examples of unanticipated
situations that arose earlier the semester that caused problems for
your team and how you mitigated the impact of those issues.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">project plan</span>] 
Provide a week-by-week plan for the rest of the semester that
lays out the objectives for each week.
The plan must identify the responsibility of each team member -
for each objective a responsible team member should be identified
as well as another team member whose job it is to "audit" progress
to determine whether the objective has been achieved.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In writing your report follow the best practices you have learned in
previous courses for technical writing. The class web page under the
heading, "On Technical Communication" has several links that may be
helpful to you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submit your written report, one per
team, via the web handin (Teams 1 and 6 to cse488 and 2-5 to cse486
