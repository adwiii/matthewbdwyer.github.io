<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Written Report:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Your team will prepare a
written report about the senior-design project that the team will
develop during the Spring of 2011.  Specifically, you will report
on the outcome of the mini-project that you completed this semester.
The proposal should contain:</p>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">why</span>]&nbsp; An
introduction to the general field of and motivations for the proposed
project focus.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">what</span>] A
description of the projected functionalities, main components, and
physical appearance of the final product.  This should include
a comprehensive description of the use-cases your product will
support; use cases can be described textually or graphically, but
each must be accompanied by a narrative that describes the context and 
goal of the use case.
</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">how</span>]&nbsp; A
description of the proposed approaches (designs, algorithms, hardware
needed, etc) to realizing the projected functionalities.
Special attention should be given to the interfaces that your
product will consume and provide.  More specifically, it is
expected that you document the interaction between your product,
the user, and any associated products by way of message sequence
charts - or a similar notation.  The point here is to clearly describe
the functionality in your product and how it uses functionality
that resides elsewhere.
</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">quality</span>]&nbsp; A
description of your plans for determining that your product functions
correctly.  You must describe plans for unit testing, integration
testing, and system level testing.  

For transit projects, unit testing is expected to be
integrated into the development cycle of your product.  System level
testing must commence before the end of March 2011 - the month of 
April 2011 will be devoted primarily to testing and refinment of your
product.
</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">risk-analysis and mitigation</span>]&nbsp;
Identify the key obstacles that you expect toward achieving your goal.
We are interested in technical obstacles that are specific to your
project, not generic obstacles like illness.  Each risk that you identify
must be accompanied by a mitigation plan involving your approach to 
tracking the status of each risk
and resolving the risk.
</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>[<span style="font-weight: bold;">project plan</span>] Include
a project plan and a weekly schedule for the Spring semester for
achieving your goals.  The schedule should provide a detailed
set of objectives for each week and you must
describe how you will evaluate whether each objective is met.
The plan must identify the responsibility of each team member -
for each objective a responsible team member should be identified
as well as another team member whose job it is to "audit" progress
to determine whether the objective has been achieved.
For transit projects, the goal is to complete development by the
end of March 2011.  System and field testing will be the primary
focus during April 2011 along with preparation for deployment of
products.  Your plans should reflect these overall goals.
</li>

</ul>

<p>In writing your report follow the best practices you have learned in
previous courses for technical writing. The class web page under the
heading, "Useful Info" has several links that may be helpful to you.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submit your written report, one per
team, via the web handin (Teams 1 and 6 to cse488 and 2-5 to cse486
handin) by midnight Dec. 12, 2010. </span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Oral Report:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>You must prepare a
PowerPoint presentation for your project using PowerPoint. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your presentation should take 20 minutes.</span>.  
Presentations will be made during the final exam slot for the course,
Dec. 13, 2010 from 7:30-9:30am, starting with team 1 and proceeding,
in order, through team 6.

<p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Submit your PowerPoint
presentation, one per team, via the web handin (Teams 1 and 6 to
cse488 and 2-5 to cse486 handin) by midnight Dec. 12. </span></p>
