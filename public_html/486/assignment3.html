</div>
<p>
This assignment is based on the textbook, <i>Inviting Disaster: Lessons
from the Edge of Technology</i>.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the assignment is to provide practice in reading
comprehension and oral presentation. In a nutshell, your team will
be asked to make an oral presentation summarizing the key points
of a chapter of the textbook in about <i>20 minutes</i> and
then lead a discussion on the material for about <i>15 minutes</i>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the presentation and discussion of the topic of
a textbook chapter, your presentation should identify several
other problems with engineered systems that exhibit the same
underlying cause as the topic in the chapter.  You are free
to consult any resource, but you may find 
<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/">The Risks Digest</a> a
useful source of reports on problems with computer-related
systems.
</p>
<p>
All students in the class are expected to have read through the
chapter ahead of time and you may use this fact in organizing your
presentation and discussion. As part of this home work, you are
also asked to devise a simple <i>10-minute</i> questionnaire for the
students that would verify their familiarity with the
material.
</p>
<p>
Your team's grade will be based on the following guidelines:
<ul>
<li>
<b>(20 points) Presentation Organization:</b>&nbsp;
The talk should be a <i>team </i>presentation of the chapter summary in
a logical, easy-to-follow manner and with smooth transitions between
team members.
</li><li>
<b>(20 points) Use of Visual Aids:</b>&nbsp;
You should make effective use of visual aids (white board, presentation
slides, etc.).&nbsp;
Visual aids should be neat, organized, and legible.&nbsp;
Note that the current trend is away from slide-only presentations.
</li><li>
<b>(20 points) Adherence to Time Constraints:</b>&nbsp;
Be sure to observe the specified times for the presentation and
discussion.&nbsp;
Come prepared with leading questions for the discussion, in case the
questions from the audience dry up.
</li><li>
<b>(20 points) Demonstrated Understanding of Material:</b>&nbsp;
Your presentation and your team's responses during the discussion should
demonstrate a good understanding of the material in the text.&nbsp;
The quality of your questionnaire will be rolled into this category.
</li><li>
<b>(20 points) Speaking Quality:</b>&nbsp;
You should speak clearly and project your voice.&nbsp;
Verbal clutter such as "uh" and "um" should be avoided.&nbsp;
The audience should be effectively engaged with eye contact and
appropriate body language.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that besides the instructor and the TA, the rest of the class also
will be asked to evaluate your presentation on the above points.&nbsp;
We will not use this feedback for grading but will pass it on to you for
your benefit.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note to the rest of the class:</b>&nbsp;
Your performance on the questionnaires and actively participating in the
discussion will be credited towards classroom participation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Each team should send Dr. Dwyer an <a href="mailto:dwyer@cse.unl.edu">email</a> that lists, in order of preference, three chapters from the book
that they would like to present.  Do not choose Chapter 3 as we will
be covering that topic in class as a group. Your email should be received
by September 17, 2010.
