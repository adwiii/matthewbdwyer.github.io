<h2>
Java Packages
</h2>

<p>Java interfaces and classes are grouped into <em>packages</em>.  The following are the java packages, from which you can access interfaces and classes, and then fields, constructors, and methods.
<p> 

<dl>
<dt><a href="Package-java.lang.html">java.lang</a></dt>
<dd>Package that contains essential Java classes, including numerics, strings, objects, compiler, runtime, security, and threads.  This is the only package that is automatically imported into every Java program.

<dt><a href="Package-java.io.html">java.io</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes to manage input and output streams to read data from and write data to files, strings, and other sources. 

<dt><a href="Package-java.util.html">java.util</a>
<dd>Package that contains miscellaneous utility classes, including generic data structures, bit sets, time, date, string manipulation, random number generation, system properties, notification, and enumeration of data structures.

<dt><a href="Package-java.net.html">java.net</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes for network support, including URLs, TCP sockets, UDP sockets, IP addresses, and a binary-to-text converter.

<dt><a href="Package-java.awt.html">java.awt</a>
<dd>Package that provides an integrated set of classes to manage user interface components such as windows, dialog boxes, buttons, checkboxes, lists, menus, scrollbars, and text fields. (AWT = Abstract Window Toolkit) 

<dt><a href="Package-java.awt.image.html">java.awt.image</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes for managing image data, including color models, cropping, color filtering, setting pixel values, and grabbing snapshots. 

<dt><a href="Package-java.awt.peer.html">java.awt.peer</a>
<dd>Package that connects AWT components to their platform-specific implementations (such as Motif widgets or Microsoft Windows controls).

<dt><a href="Package-java.applet.html">java.applet</a>
<dd>Package that enables the creation of applets through the Applet class.  It also provides several interfaces that connect an applet to its document and to resources for playing audio. 

</dl>

<h2>
Sun Packages
</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="Package-sun.tools.debug.html">sun.tools.debug</a></dt>
<dd>Package that contains the debug interfaces and classes.

<blockquote>
<p>This document was generated using WebWorks, taken from the FrameMaker files just prior to the final proofreading, that are published as <a href="/Series">"Java Application Programming Interface: Volumes 1 and 2"</a> by Addison-Wesley. It has some minor typographical errors that were corrected in the printed version. For the current list of errata, please see: <a href="http://java.sun.com/Series/API/errata.html">Errata</a>. <!--This version has been revised and updated by the JavaSoft engineers and thus represents the most current documentation for Java 1.0.2.-->
 
<p>Because this HTML document was generated from FrameMaker, not javadoc, it is currently missing three important features that were in the previous 1.0 (javadoc) version:  the Class Hierarchy page (which lists all of the classes), the class hierarchy at the top of each class page, and links to data types of method arguments.  We apologize for their absence, and plan to add these back in the next major release of Java, JDK 1.1.
