      <p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Project Reports</font></b></p>

      Project reports are a written document that communicates the
      content of your semester project.  Each team will produce
      a well-written and formatted document covering each of the
      following topics: 

      <ul>
      <li> <em>Problem statement</em> : what problem are you solving and
           why is it important
      <li> <em>Solution strategy</em> : a description of your approach
           to solving the problem.  This should be at a somewhat
           high level so that anyone in the class could easily
           understand what you are doing.
      <li> <em>Detailed technical solution</em> : here you dive into the
           full details of your technical approach.  What algorithms 
           and data structures did you use?   Did you adapt an 
           existing solution framework, if so, describe exactly
           how and why.
      <li> <em>Implementation</em> : provide an overview of your implementation
           efforts.  You don't need to include code, but if there were
           particular coding challenges that you had to overcome please
           include them here.   Efficient implementation approaches 
           are an important aspect of program analysis, so document them. 
      <li> <em>Evaluation</em> : how did you assess the quality of your solution?
           Describe evaluation subjects, criteria and present results.
      <li> <em>Limitations</em> : What were the limits on your solution?  
      <li> <em>Future Work</em> : Based on the results of your project do you
           see interesting extensions that could be made to 
           make the solution more effective, relieve important limitations,
           or apply it to interesting SE problems.
      <li> <em>Existing solutions and related work</em> : a summary 
           of existing solutions for your problem along
           with a substantive comparison of your project to the
           existing work.
      <li> <em>Bibliography</em> : citations for all of the related work
      </ul>

      You are free to organize this content in any way you like, but it
      should all be in the report.  If you need to include diagrams or
      other figures to produce a clear report please do so.
