<h1><font face="Arial" size="5">Academic Conduct</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have any condition, such as a physical or 
learning disability, which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work 
as I have outlined it or which will require academic accommodations, please 
notify me in the first two weeks of the course. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Department of Computer Science
and Engineering at UNL has a
<a href="http://cse.unl.edu/undergrads/academic_integrity.php">policy on academic integrity</a>.
For this course, you are expected to abide by those general guidelines as well as those
outlined in the university's code of student conduct.
<p>
More specifically, it is expected that all work in this class 
will be done individually by you in response to assignments given in this class.
You are not allowed to collaborate in producing a solution to an
assigned problem unless it is specifically approved by your instructor.
You are allowed to discuss problems and general solution approaches
with other students; you have crossed the line when you base your solution
to a problem on the details of another persons solution obtained
verbally, in writing, or via any other means.  You are not allowed to re-use
previous solutions of problems that you have produced prior to the course
without receiving the permission of the instructor.  If in doubt on any
of these matters, simply contact the instructor to clarify whether your
solution is acceptable.
<p>
If you are caught using another persons work, either intentionally or
unintentionally, 
on any quiz, project assignment, or exam
or if I suspect that you have done so, the following
actions will ensue.
I will discuss the matter with you in person.  At that time, if you are
unable to eliminate my suspicions I will give you an <em>oral</em>
examination on the material of said quiz, project assignment, or exam. 
At that point I will either replace your grade on the assignment
with the result of the oral exam, or, if your results on the oral
exam confirm that you could not have produced the work that you
submitted as your own I will consider that a breach of the academic
integrity policy, you will receive a grade of <em>F</em> in the course,
and your case will be refered to the proper university officials.
<p>
The academic integrity system of the department governs
the behavior of graduate students as well.
