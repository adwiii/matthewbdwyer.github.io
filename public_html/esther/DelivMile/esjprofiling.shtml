      <h1><font face="Arial" size="5">Milestone
Grad : Profiling for ESJ</font></h1>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Your task in this milestone is to extend the existing code
generation support for ESJ developed in Milestone 5 to
achieve rudimentary performance profiling support.
Tools like <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">jProfiler</a> provide sophisticated mechanisms for recording
information about a program's execution behavior and presenting
that information to developers so that they can detect, for example,
performance hot-spots and memory leaks.
</p>
<p>
This milestone consists of two parts.
</p>
<p>
First, you will implement a much more rudimentary capability much like
that in <em>gprof</em>.
More specifically, you will modify your code generator to insert
bytecodes that record
the number of times that each <em>block of code</em> in the
code is executed.  A block of code is a sequential run of statements.
Control structures like, <em>if</em> and <em>for</em>, introduce
branches that interrupt sequential runs of statements.  
Your solution must print a list of blocks that is
ordered based on execution count - from high to low.
</p>
<p> 
Second, you will optimize your code generation strategy to minimize
the number of inserted bytecodes.  This optimization will be driven
by an analysis of statement <em>dominator</em> information; see the
Dragon book Chapter 9.6.1 for a definition.  By calculating dominators,
you will be able to determine whether some of the inserted bytecodes
can be removed without losing any block execution count information.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you will develope a set of test programs that illustrate
the correctness and effectiveness of your solution.  For each test
program, you will provide the number of bytecodes generated and the
ordered list of blocks; the latter information should be identical
for both unoptimized and optimized code generation strategies. 
</p>
      <p>You must submit
your assignment through the course <a href="http://cse.unl.edu/~cse425/handin">Project Upload</a> site
by 11:59pm CDT on Friday Dec 21, 2007.

      <h3><font face="Arial" size="4">Setup</font></h3>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>
      Download the file <a href="myname-milestoneGrad.zip">myname-milestoneGrad.zip</a
>
      <p>
      This contains a solution for milestone 5 which will serve
as your starting point.
      <p>
In order to import the projects into your workspace, do the following:
<p>
Goto the "File" menu, select "Import". Expand "General" and select "Existing Pro
jects into Workspace". Click "Next". Select "Select archive file:" and click the
 "Browse" button associated with it. In the file browser, points to the mileston
e2.zip that you downloaded.
<p>
You should see "solution-milestone5", check the box,
and click "Finish".
<p>
If you run Eclipse appropriately (i.e., using Java 5.0 and the right versions of
 plugins and by following the instructions in the course quick notes website), y
our workspace should be set. 
<p>
Make sure you rename the project appropriately, e.g.,
use your CIS username and change the "5" to "Grad", by
ght clicking the project, select "Refactor" -> "Rename...".

      <h3><font face="Arial" size="4">Instructions and Hints</font></h3>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>You are provided with a working version of an ESJ code generator
         as a starting point.</p>

      <p>You are expected to operate more independently on this project.
         In particular, no JUnit test driver is provided - you must construct
         one.</p>

      <p>It is possible to calculate dominator information in several different
         ways, e.g., the algorithm in the book, or using an instance of the 
         MDF.

      <hr>
      <h3><font face="Arial" size="4">What To Submit</font></h3>

<font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>Your solution should consist of the following :</p>

      <ul>

<li>Unlike the other projects, for this one I expect you to explain
at a reasonable level of detail what you implemented.  Think of it
as providing documentation that you could come back to in 6 months and
be able to pick up where you left off, e.g., include design decisions,
alternatives skipped and why, etc.  This documentation should
summarize your findings for your test cases (see below).</li>

<li>An extended bytecode generator that generates code for performance
profiling with optional optimization.</li>

<li>At least four non-trivial tests that exercise the functionality
of your solution.  Tests with significant overlap will not count
towards the total of four.</li>

      </ul>
</p>
Export your solution project as a single file named 
<em>yourname</em>-milestoneGrad.zip, including your documentation
in the root directory of the project, and upload that file.
<p>
Your Grading will be based on your solution (60%), your tests (20%),
and your documentation (20%).
