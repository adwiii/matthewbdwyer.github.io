<hr size=4>

Chain patterns are used to express requirements related
to complex combinations of individual state/event relationships.
These include precedence/response relationships consisting of
sequences of individual states/events.  We call these chain patterns.
<p>
Both 
<a href="response-chain.html">Response</a> and
<a href="precedence-chain.html">Precedence</a> chains are provided.
<p>
A variation of the chain patterns is to
<a href="constrained.html">constrain</a> the regions between
the state/events that constitute the chain sequences.
<p>
As with all patterns, we define the regions over which the pattern
is to hold using <a href="scopes.html">scopes</a>.
