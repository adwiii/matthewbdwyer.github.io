<A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000"></A>Replicated Workers Framework</H1>
We specified properties of a generic, programming framework (written in
Ada) that supports distribution and concurrent execution of sub-computations
(see the <A HREF="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~dwyer/CAS/cas.html">coordination
abstraction</A> web pages for details).

<P>These specifications use a collection of propositions defined in a finite-state
model of a configuration of the programming framework that instantiates
it to have three (internal) tasks. The framework maintains an internal
work pool whose size is represented by propositions whose name begins with
"workCount". Other propositions are introduced below as needed.
<BR>We expressed all the formulae in terms of "event predicates". An event
reffers to an ADA rendezvous or to an internal event .&nbsp; An event predicate
is true if any task containing the event specified is in a state immediately
following a transition on that event.
<BR>In addition we used, some "state predicates", to capture states of
variables in the system (for example the states in which workCount is zero).

<P>The framework is not a complete application, for example, there are
parameters that are undefined. We can employ existing model checkers, e.g.,
SPIN, to analyze such incomplete systems by specifying assumptions about
the intended behaviour of the missing components and using those specifications
to restrict model checking to paths in the finite-state model that conform
to intended component behavior. We use property specification patterns
both for correctness properties and for parameter and calling context assumptions.
<H1>
Properties Analyzed</H1>
In the following, we use the LTL mappings from the patterns. We provide
the <I>(i)</I> initial informal english statement of the requirement, <I>(ii)</I>
a refined version of the english that explicitly refers to the propositions
available in the finite-state model, <I>(iii)</I> the pattern and scope
used and finally <I>(iv)</I> the instantiation of the pattern mapping.
<UL>
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> No work will be scheduled before execution.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I> No "GetWork" before the ActivePool&nbsp; task accepts "Execute".
Event "GetWork" represents rendezvous on entry "Get" with argument "done"
set to false.

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="absence.html">absence</A>,
scope: before

<P><I>(iv)</I>&nbsp; <B><TT>( &lt;>&nbsp; pool.Execute ) -> (( ! pool.GetWork
) U pool.Execute )</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> No work is scheduled after a worker signalized termination.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I>&nbsp; Between the moment in which the ActivePool task accepts
"Finished" from one of the workers and until a new execution of the WorkPool
task, there is no "GetWork".

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="absence.html">absence</A>,
scope: between

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>[]&nbsp; ( (pool.Finished &amp;&amp; (&lt;>&nbsp;
pool.Execute) ) -> ( ( ! pool.GetWork ) U pool.Execute ) )</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> Mutual exclusion in executing the result procedure.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I> After Worker2 task succeeded the rendezvous on entry "wait
"with ResultLock task,&nbsp; Worker1 task can not make the rendezvous on
the same "wait" entry,&nbsp; until Worker2 calls "signal" entry of ResultLock
task.

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="absence.html">absence</A>,
scope: after-until.

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>[] (resultlock.wait_worker2 -> (( ! resultlock.wait_worker1)
U (resultlock.signal_worker2 || []&nbsp; ( ! resultlock.wait_worker1))))</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> Release of resource: if a worker receives a lock, it will eventually
release the lock.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I> If a Worker2 task succeds to make a rendezvous&nbsp; on
entry "wait" it will eventually make a rendezvous on entry "signal" of
ResultLock task.

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="response.html">response</A>,
scope: globally.

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>[] (resultlock.wait_worker2 -> &lt;> resultlock.signal_worker2)</TT></B>

<P>This property did not check and in the counter example provided by SPIN,
"doResult" never returns.

<P>We added the assumption about the environment :

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>i</I>)Call-back procedures
(i.e. doWork and doResult) return.

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) </I>Procedures "doWork"
and "doResult" in tasks Worker1 and Worker2 return. Internal events ("startdoWork",
"stopdoWork", "startdoResult", "stopdoResult") in Worker tasks designate
the beginning and the end of each call back. We used the assumption: event
"startdoResult" in Worker2 leads to event "stopdoResult" in the same task.

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="response.html">response</A>,
scope: globally.

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)</I> <B><TT>( [] (startdoResult_worker2
-> &lt;> stopdoResult_worker2 ) )</TT></B>

<P>And we checked the&nbsp; "filtered" formula (in which "startdoResult"
corresponds to "wait")

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>( [] (startdoResult_worker2 -> &lt;> stopdoResult_worker2))
-> ( [] (resultlock.wait_worker2 -> &lt;> resultlock.wait_signal2))</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> The computation can terminate only when the work item list in
pool is empty or a worker signalized.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I>The computation can terminate only when the "workCount "
is zero or the ActivePool task accepted "Finished" from a Worker. We identified
termination as a state in the ActivePool task (the end of the outer loop).

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="/i> <tt><b>((! term) U (workCount_is_0 || acceptFinished_pool || [](! term)))</b></tt><p><LI> <i>(i)</i> No termination before complete.<p><i>(iii)</i> pattern: <a href=" precedence.html>precedence</A>,
scope: globally.

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>((! termination) U ( workCount_is_0 || pool.Finished
|| [] (! termination)))</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<I>(i)</I> A worker signalizes termination only if its local computation
terminates.</LI>


<P><I>(ii)</I>The ActivePool task accepts "Finished" only if "done" is
true in Worker1 task or in Worker2 task.

<P><I>(iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="/i> <tt><b>((! term) U (workCount_is_0 || acceptFinished_pool || [](! term)))</b></tt><p><LI> <i>(i)</i> No termination before complete.<p><i>(iii)</i> pattern: <a href=" precedence.html>precedence</A>,&nbsp;
scope: globally.

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>((! pool.Finished) U (done_worker2 || done_worker1
|| [] (! pool.Finished)))</TT></B>

<P>Again, this property did not check. In the counter example, the environment
(procedure "doResult" in Worker1 ) makes a call to "Finished". We used
the assumption about the call-backs:

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)</I> Call-backs do
not call entries in the same framework.

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) </I>In procedure
"doWork " in Worker1, "callprocsw" is never true. In procedure "doResult"
in Worker1, "callprocsr "is never true. The same can be written for Worker2;
"callprocsw" and "callprocsr"&nbsp; identify the states in wich a "doWork"
procedure (and a "doResult" procedure respectively) in a Worker task, makes
a call to a procedure in the interface of the framework.

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)</I> pattern: <A HREF="absence.html">absence</A>,&nbsp;
scope: globally

<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B><TT>([] (! callprocsw_worker1))</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ([] (! callprocsr_worker1))</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ([] (! callprocsw_worker2))</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ([] (! callprocsr_worker2))</TT></B>

<P>We attempted to check the "filtered" formula:

<P><I>(iv)</I> <B><TT>([] (! callprocsr_worker1)) -> ((! pool.Finished)
U (done_worker2 || done_worker1 || [] (! pool.Finished)))</TT></B>

<P>Again, this property did not check. We incrementally added more filters,
and we checked in the end the following formula:

<P><I>(iv)</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><TT>(([] (! callprocsw_worker1))
&amp;&amp; ([] (! callprocsr_worker1)) &amp;&amp;</TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ([] (! callprocsw_worker2)) &amp;&amp;
([] (! callprocsr_worker2)) ) -></TT></B>
<BR><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((! pool.Finished) U (done_worker2
|| done_worker1 || [] (! pool.Finished)))</TT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
